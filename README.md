# CodeTests

Final consideration:
- As it was not defined on the information, the result is printed through console with the format as requested.
- There is a commented execution for a method in the Main class called "resultAsString" that returns a complete String(considering the new lines and paragraphs) as the example in the document instructions.
- The code is ready to be used just the method "compareChoices(Types playerAChoice, Types playerBChoice)", where using the parameter the game rules can be used in a simple way. 
To make it easier different tests, the values for player A choices and the quantity of games, are a constant and are on the main class for the application(Main.java).
- As there is no information on document instructions, there are no validation for null, 0 or empty parameters, as well exception verifications.

You can see it, below, some execution from the application with different results.
